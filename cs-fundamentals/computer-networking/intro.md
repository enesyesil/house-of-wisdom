## 1. What Is a Computer Network?

### Plain English Definition

A computer network is a **system that connects two or more computing devices** (like laptops, phones, or servers) so they can share data and resources. These devices are connected by communication links such as cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals.

A network allows applications—like email, video calls, or file sharing—to operate across devices, no matter how far apart they are.

> Without networks, each device would be isolated—no internet, no shared drives, no cloud.

---

### Real-World Metaphor

Imagine a **postal system** for digital messages:

- **Devices (computers, phones)** are houses in different cities.
- **Packets** are letters placed in envelopes.
- **Links** are the roads, air routes, or sea lanes that carry the letters.
- **Routers** are postal sorting centers that decide where each envelope goes next.
- **Protocols** are the shared language and formats used by everyone in the postal system (like stamps, addresses, or customs forms).

Just as a global mail system allows you to send a letter anywhere in the world, a computer network lets your device send and receive messages across the internet.

---

### Simple Example

You open your laptop and visit `www.example.com`:

1. Your laptop sends a request to a **DNS server** to translate the domain name into an IP address.
2. The request is **broken into packets**, like splitting a book into pages.
3. The packets travel across multiple **routers and networks**, hopping from node to node.
4. The server at `example.com` sends back packets that **reassemble into a web page** in your browser.

All of this happens in milliseconds—and it only works because the devices agree to use shared **protocols** and follow strict communication rules.

---

## 2. What Is the Internet?

### Plain English Definition

The Internet is a **global network of interconnected networks**. It connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks into one massive communication system.

> The Internet isn’t a single network—it’s a system that connects many different networks that agree to communicate using shared protocols.

Each part of the Internet is managed by different organizations, but they all follow the same rules to ensure data flows smoothly.

---

### Real-World Metaphor

Think of the Internet like the **global airline system**:

- **Each country** has its own airlines (local networks).
- They all agree on **air traffic rules** and use **shared airports and routes**.
- **Passengers (packets)** travel between countries by switching through airports (routers).
- No single airline owns the entire system—but everyone agrees on how planes take off, land, and route passengers.

The Internet works the same way—every participant agrees to common communication rules like **IP, TCP, and DNS**.

---

### Core Concepts of the Internet

#### 1. **Autonomous Systems (ASes)**
These are independent network domains (like ISPs or large universities) that control their internal routing but connect to others using **BGP** (Border Gateway Protocol).

#### 2. **End Systems (Hosts)**
Computers, phones, and IoT devices connected to the network. They **run applications** like browsers, chat, and video.

#### 3. **Routers**
Specialized devices that forward packets between networks. They form the **core of the Internet**.

#### 4. **Links**
The physical or wireless connections between routers and hosts: copper, fiber optic, Wi-Fi, LTE, etc.

#### 5. **Protocols**
The **rules and message formats** that devices follow to talk to each other. Key Internet protocols include:
- **IP** (routing and addressing)
- **TCP/UDP** (transport)
- **DNS** (naming)
- **HTTP/HTTPS** (web communication)

---

### Example: A Packet’s Journey

Let’s say your laptop sends a request to YouTube:

1. **DNS** translates `youtube.com` to an IP address.
2. Your laptop sends the request via **TCP/IP** to that IP.
3. The packet travels through your ISP, then several **autonomous systems**, each forwarding it closer to YouTube.
4. YouTube responds with video data—sent back through the Internet to you.

This end-to-end journey is powered by a set of decentralized but cooperating protocols and devices.

---

## 3. Performance Metrics

Understanding how well a network performs requires measuring how fast and reliably it delivers data. These measurements are essential for designing, debugging, and scaling real-world systems.

---

### A. Delay (Latency)

**Delay** is the time it takes for data to travel from the sender to the receiver. There are several types of delay:

| Type                    | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Processing Delay**    | Time for a router or device to process a packet header.            |
| **Queuing Delay**       | Time a packet waits in line (in a buffer) before being forwarded.  |
| **Transmission Delay**  | Time to push all packet bits onto the wire.                        |
| **Propagation Delay**   | Time for bits to physically travel across the link (distance/speed).|

> **Total end-to-end delay** is the sum of all these delays over each hop.

---

### B. Bandwidth

**Bandwidth** is the maximum rate at which data can be sent over a link, typically measured in bits per second (bps).

- Example: A 100 Mbps link can transmit 100 million bits every second.
- Often confused with **throughput**, but bandwidth is the **theoretical maximum**.

---

### C. Throughput

**Throughput** is the actual data transfer rate achieved between two endpoints.

- Affected by congestion, protocol overhead, and retransmissions.
- Varies over time depending on network conditions.

> If bandwidth is the width of a pipe, throughput is how much water actually flows through it.

---

### D. Packet Loss

**Packet loss** occurs when packets are dropped by routers or switches due to congestion or errors.

- Can cause delays or require retransmissions (if using TCP).
- Affects performance in video streaming, gaming, and real-time apps.

---

### E. Jitter

**Jitter** is the variation in packet delay.

- Especially important for **real-time traffic** (voice, video).
- High jitter causes uneven audio or video playback.

---

### F. Trade-Off Triangle

| Performance Goal | Related Metric        | Trade-Off Example                        |
|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Fast delivery**| Low delay              | May increase packet loss if buffers are small |
| **Smooth playback**| Low jitter           | Requires consistent routing & buffering  |
| **High speed**   | High throughput        | Can cause congestion and higher delay    |
| **Reliable data**| Low packet loss        | Often means adding retransmission overhead |

---

### Mental Model: The Highway

- **Bandwidth** is the number of lanes.
- **Throughput** is how many cars actually move through.
- **Delay** is how long it takes a car to go from point A to B.
- **Packet loss** is cars that get removed or crash.
- **Jitter** is variation in trip time between cars.

---

## 4. Types of Communication Services

Different applications have different needs—some require speed, others need reliability, and some must guarantee the order of messages. Network protocols offer different **types of services** depending on the layer and configuration.

---

### A. Connection-Oriented vs Connectionless

| Type                  | Description                                                   | Example Protocols |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Connection-Oriented** | Establishes a dedicated path or session before transmitting.   | TCP, QUIC         |
| **Connectionless**     | Sends data without setup—each packet is independent.          | UDP, IP           |

- TCP connections involve a **3-way handshake**, keeping track of order and delivery.
- UDP just sends packets and hopes they arrive—no setup, no memory.

---

### B. Reliable vs Unreliable

| Type             | Description                                             | Common Use Cases            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Reliable**     | Ensures data is delivered, in order, without duplication. | File transfer, web browsing |
| **Unreliable**   | No guarantees—packets may be lost or reordered.          | Live video, DNS, gaming     |

Reliable service involves:
- **Acknowledgments (ACKs)**
- **Retransmissions**
- **Timeouts**

> TCP provides reliable service. UDP does not—but applications can implement their own error handling if needed.

---

### C. In-Order vs Out-of-Order Delivery

- **In-Order:** Packets arrive in the same order they were sent.  
  → Required for most applications like downloads, emails, or websites.

- **Out-of-Order:** Packets may arrive at different times or be dropped.  
  → Fine for streaming or real-time data where freshness is more important than exact order.

---

### D. Message-Oriented vs Stream-Oriented

| Mode               | Description                                | Example |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Stream-Oriented** | Continuous byte stream with no boundaries. | TCP     |
| **Message-Oriented** | Discrete messages are preserved.           | UDP, QUIC (with datagrams) |

---

### Choosing the Right Service

| Application Type   | Needs Reliable? | Ordered? | Connection? | Protocol |
|--------------------|------------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| File Transfer       | ✅               | ✅        | ✅            | TCP      |
| Video Call          | ❌               | ❌        | Optional      | UDP/RTP  |
| Web Browsing        | ✅               | ✅        | ✅            | TCP/QUIC |
| Online Multiplayer  | ❌               | ❌        | ❌            | UDP      |

---

### Summary

Understanding these service types helps you pick the right protocol for your application's needs. Not every app needs 100% reliability or strict ordering—**performance often comes from knowing what you can safely leave out**.

---

## 5. Edge vs Core of the Internet

The Internet can be logically divided into two major parts:

1. **The Edge** – where users and applications live  
2. **The Core** – the network backbone that routes traffic globally

Understanding this distinction helps explain performance, architecture, and responsibility boundaries in real systems.

---

### A. The Network Edge

The **edge** includes:

- **End systems (hosts):** Laptops, phones, servers, IoT devices  
- **Applications:** Web browsers, email clients, games, streaming apps  
- **Access networks:** The connections that bring these devices online

#### Types of Access Networks

| Access Network Type | Description                          | Examples                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Home Network**     | Connects to ISP via cable/DSL/fiber  | Wi-Fi router + ISP modem        |
| **Enterprise LAN**   | Wired Ethernet + Wi-Fi at workplaces | Office networks, campus LANs    |
| **Mobile Networks**  | Cellular connectivity                | 4G/5G, mobile hotspots          |

> The edge is where **user experience is felt**, and where devices talk to routers for the first time.

---

### B. The Network Core

The **core** includes:

- **High-speed routers and switches** that move packets across long distances
- **Autonomous Systems (ASes)** — independently operated networks (ISPs, cloud providers)
- **Interconnection points (IXPs)** — where large networks exchange traffic

#### Characteristics

- **Packet-switched** architecture (more flexible than circuit switching)
- **No centralized control** — routing is distributed and dynamic
- Built for **redundancy and high throughput**

---

### C. ISP Hierarchy and Tiers

| Tier | Description                          | Example Entities              |
|------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Global ISPs that peer with each other | AT&T, NTT, Level 3             |
| **Tier 2** | Regional ISPs buying from Tier 1    | Bell, Comcast, Rogers          |
| **Tier 3** | Local ISPs that connect homes/offices | TekSavvy, Start.ca             |

> Packets often pass from **edge → Tier 3 → Tier 2 → Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → edge**.

---

### D. Real-World Example

1. Your laptop sends a request via Wi-Fi → to your home router (edge).
2. It enters your ISP’s local access network (Tier 3).
3. Routed through the ISP’s backbone (core).
4. Routed across regional or global ASes (core).
5. Delivered to a server at Google or Netflix (edge again).

---

### Summary Table

| Category | Contains                        | Responsible For                          |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Edge** | Devices, apps, user access       | Running applications, initiating traffic  |
| **Core** | Routers, ASes, IXPs              | Delivering packets across global paths    |

---

## 6. Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching

Before the Internet, communication systems were built around **circuit switching**—used by traditional telephone networks. The Internet, however, relies on **packet switching**, which is more efficient and scalable for digital data.

Let’s compare them in detail.

---

### A. What Is Circuit Switching?

In **circuit switching**, a dedicated path (circuit) is established between the sender and receiver for the duration of the session.

- Resources (bandwidth) are reserved ahead of time.
- The path stays active even if no data is being sent.
- Used in traditional **PSTN (landline phones)**.

#### Metaphor: A private highway lane  
Once reserved, it’s all yours—but even if you don’t drive on it, no one else can use it.

---

### B. What Is Packet Switching?

In **packet switching**, data is broken into small units called packets. Each packet is routed independently, potentially taking different paths to reach the destination.

- Resources are not reserved—network nodes forward packets as they arrive.
- Efficient for bursty traffic (most modern applications).
- Used by the **Internet**.

#### Metaphor: Mailing individual letters  
Each packet is like a separate envelope—it might take a different route and arrive at a slightly different time.

---

### C. Key Comparison Table

| Feature                 | Circuit Switching            | Packet Switching                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Resource Reservation**| Yes (pre-allocated path)     | No (shared resources)           |
| **Efficiency**          | Low (idle time wastes bandwidth) | High (link used when needed) |
| **Scalability**         | Poor                         | Excellent                       |
| **Delay**               | Consistent (after setup)     | Variable (due to queuing)       |
| **Example Use Case**    | Phone calls                  | Internet, streaming, file transfer |

---

### D. Why the Internet Chose Packet Switching

- **Statistical multiplexing** allows sharing of links among many flows.
- Supports unpredictable and bursty traffic efficiently.
- Simpler to scale to billions of devices.

---

### E. Hybrid: Virtual Circuits (Preview)

Some protocols (like **MPLS**) try to combine both:

- Use packet switching underneath
- Maintain a virtual path like circuits
- Useful in telecom and enterprise networks

---

### Summary

- **Circuit switching** is predictable but wasteful.
- **Packet switching** is flexible and efficient, though less predictable.
- The Internet uses **packet switching** because it matches the nature of data traffic: fast, bursty, and unpredictable.

---

## 7. Protocol Layering & Service Models (Preview)

Computer networks are built in **layers**, where each layer provides a specific set of services to the one above it and relies on the layer below. This modular design makes networks **easier to manage, evolve, and troubleshoot**.

---

### A. What Is Protocol Layering?

- Each layer handles one aspect of communication (e.g., addressing, routing, encryption).
- Layers **communicate only with their immediate neighbors** (above and below).
- Layers **encapsulate** their data by wrapping it in a header.

#### Real-World Metaphor: Sending a Package

1. You write a letter (Application layer).
2. You put it in an envelope with a name (Transport).
3. You add an address (Network).
4. The delivery truck carries it (Link).
5. The roads and physical delivery get it there (Physical).

Each layer **adds its own wrapper** and **trusts** the layer below to deliver it correctly.

---

### B. OSI vs. TCP/IP Models

| OSI Model              | TCP/IP Model           | Function                        |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 7. Application         | Application            | User-level logic (HTTP, DNS)    |
| 6. Presentation        | —                      | Formatting, encryption (TLS)    |
| 5. Session             | —                      | Connection management (rare)    |
| 4. Transport           | Transport              | End-to-end delivery (TCP, UDP)  |
| 3. Network             | Network                | Routing & addressing (IP)       |
| 2. Data Link           | Link                   | Local delivery (Ethernet, ARP)  |
| 1. Physical            | Physical               | Bits on wires or waves          |

> Most real-world systems follow **TCP/IP**, not strict OSI.

---

### C. Key Layering Concepts

- **Encapsulation:** Each layer adds headers (and sometimes trailers) around the data.  
- **Decapsulation:** The receiver unwraps the layers in reverse order.
- **Interfaces:** Each layer exposes a clean interface to the one above—e.g., TCP offers reliable byte streams to HTTP.

---

### D. Benefits of Layering

- **Modularity:** You can upgrade one layer without breaking the others.
- **Abstraction:** Developers don’t need to worry about all layers—just the ones they use.
- **Interoperability:** Devices from different vendors can still work together.

---

### E. Visual Stack (Text Diagram)

```text
Application     ← e.g., HTTP, DNS
Transport       ← TCP, UDP
Network         ← IP
Data Link       ← Ethernet, Wi-Fi

## 8. Summary and Mental Models

Let’s wrap up the introduction by reviewing the key ideas and mental shortcuts that will help you remember and reason about networking as we go deeper into the stack.

---

### A. Big-Picture Insights

1. **A network is a system of communication.**  
   Devices exchange data using shared rules (protocols) over physical or wireless links.

2. **The Internet is a network of networks.**  
   Each network is autonomous, but all agree to follow protocols like IP and BGP.

3. **Performance is multi-dimensional.**  
   Delay, loss, jitter, and throughput all impact user experience in different ways.

4. **Designs reflect trade-offs.**  
   Packet switching gives flexibility; circuit switching gives predictability.

5. **Layering enables clarity and flexibility.**  
   Each layer solves one problem and exposes services upward.

## Foundational Takeaways

1. **The Internet is decentralized but unified**  
   No one owns it, but everyone speaks the same protocol language.

2. **Protocol design is trade-off design**  
   Reliability vs. speed, simplicity vs. flexibility, global vs. local control.

3. **Layering enables abstraction and separation of concerns**  
   This allows engineers to build robust systems where each part can evolve independently.

4. **Performance is multi-dimensional**  
   Latency, jitter, packet loss, and throughput each affect users differently depending on the application.

5. **The edge and the core have different jobs**  
   The edge runs apps and generates traffic; the core moves data efficiently and scalably.

6. **Understanding networks improves everything else**  
   Whether you're building a distributed system, debugging a slow site, or designing cloud infrastructure—networking knowledge makes you better at all of it.
