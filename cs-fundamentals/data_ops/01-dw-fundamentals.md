# Data Warehouse Fundamentals

## 1. Operational vs. Analytical Information

**Operational / Transactional Information**  
- Collected and used to support **day-to-day operational needs** in businesses and organizations.  
- Examples:  
  - Processing orders  
  - Recording customer purchases  
- Stored in **operational systems** (OLTP).  
- Focused on current transactions and frequent updates.

**Analytical Information**  
- Collected and used to support **analytical tasks**.  
- Based on operational (transactional) data.  
- Used for **decision making**.  
- Example:  
  - Analyzing monthly sales trends to adjust marketing strategy.  
- Stored in **analytical systems** (OLAP).  
- Often aggregated and organized for trend analysis.

---

## 2. Data Warehouse (DW)

A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized repository designed specifically for analytical processing and decision support.

**Purpose:**
- Collect operational data from **internal** and **external** sources.
- Store it in a **single location** for better accessibility by executives, managers, and analysts.
- Enable advanced querying, manipulation, and reporting using **OLAP** (On-Line Analytical Processing) tools.

**Key Concept:**
- A DW is **separate** from operational databases to avoid performance issues when running analytical queries alongside daily transactions.
- It addresses the fact that **one database cannot efficiently serve both operational and analytical needs** due to their **conflicting design requirements**.

---

## 3. Why Data Warehouse?

**Two main reasons for creating a Data Warehouse as a separate analytical database:**

1. **Performance**  
   - Day-to-day operational tasks can slow down significantly if analytical queries compete for the same computing resources.
   - Separating analytical workloads prevents operational systems from being overloaded.

2. **Different Design Requirements**  
   - Operational systems (OLTP) are optimized for transaction processing and frequent updates.
   - Analytical systems (OLAP) are optimized for complex queries, trend analysis, and aggregated reporting.
   - A single database cannot be optimized for both purposes at once.

---

## 4. Data Warehouse Definition

A **Data Warehouse** is:

> An **integrated**, **subject-oriented**, **time-variant**, and **non-volatile** database that provides support for decision making.

**Meaning of the Key Terms:**

- **Integrated**  
  - Combines data from multiple sources into a unified view.  
  - Ensures consistent naming, formats, and codes across the organization.

- **Subject-Oriented**  
  - Organized around key business subjects (e.g., sales, inventory, customers) rather than specific applications or processes.  
  - Supports analysis across functional areas.

- **Time-Variant**  
  - Stores historical data for trend analysis.  
  - Can include both past and projected data.

- **Non-Volatile**  
  - Once data enters the warehouse, it is not changed or removed.  
  - The warehouse continually grows over time, supporting stable and repeatable analysis.


---

## 5. Data Warehouse Characteristics

A Data Warehouse typically exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **Integrated**  
   - Centralized and consolidated database that merges data from across the organization.
   - Resolves inconsistencies in naming, formats, and measurement units.

2. **Subject-Oriented**  
   - Organized around major business topics such as sales, inventory, customers, or products.
   - Designed to answer questions from different functional areas.

3. **Time-Variant**  
   - Maintains historical data to analyze trends over time.
   - May include projections or future forecasts.
   - Data changes are tracked and preserved.

4. **Non-Volatile**  
   - Data is stableâ€”once loaded, it is not updated or deleted.
   - Data is only appended through new loads.

5. **Summarized**  
   - Data may be aggregated for analysis or reporting to improve query performance.

6. **Analytics-Oriented**  
   - Designed for analytical queries and decision support rather than transaction processing.

---

## 14. Data Integration and the Extraction, Transformation, and Load (ETL) Process

**Data Integration**  
- Combines data from multiple, often heterogeneous, sources into a unified view for analysis.
- Ensures consistency in data formats, naming conventions, and measurement units.

**ETL Process:**
1. **Extraction**  
   - Reading data from source systems (operational databases, external feeds, flat files, etc.).
2. **Transformation**  
   - Converting extracted data into a consistent format suitable for loading into the Data Warehouse.
   - Includes data cleansing, format conversions, and applying business rules.
3. **Load**  
   - Storing the transformed data into the Data Warehouse for long-term analysis.

**Importance:**  
- ETL is the backbone of Data Warehousing, ensuring that analytical systems work with clean, consistent, and reliable data.

---

## 15. Data Cleansing

**Definition:**  
Data cleansing (or data scrubbing) is the process of detecting and correctingâ€”or removingâ€”corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant records from a dataset, table, or database.

**Goals:**
- Improve data quality by removing or correcting incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent information.
- Ensure that analytical results are accurate and reliable.

**Typical Tasks:**
- Identifying missing or null values.
- Correcting data entry errors.
- Standardizing formats (e.g., date formats, capitalization).
- Removing duplicate records.
- Resolving inconsistencies across datasets.

**Example:**  
If a customer database contains entries for "NY" and "New York" as state values, data cleansing would standardize both to the same representation.

---

## 16. ETL Tools

**Purpose:**  
ETL tools automate and streamline the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data into a Data Warehouse.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Connectivity:** Communicate with various relational databases and different file formats.

- Talend Open Studio
- Apache NiFi


---

## 17. Star Schema (Dimensional Model)

**Definition:**  
A **Star Schema** is a data modeling technique used to map multidimensional decision-support data into a relational database.

**Key Features:**
- The central table is the **fact table**, which stores quantitative measurements (facts).
- Surrounding the fact table are **dimension tables**, which contain descriptive attributes related to the facts.
- The structure visually resembles a star, with the fact table at the center and dimension tables radiating outward.

**Advantages:**
- Simple and intuitive for business users.
- Optimized for querying and reporting in analytical systems.
- Preserves the relational structure while enabling multidimensional analysis.

**Use Case:**
- Common in **OLAP** systems for sales analysis, inventory tracking, and other business performance evaluations.

---

## 18. Fact Tables

**Definition:**  
A **fact table** contains the quantitative measurements (facts) related to the subject of analysis, along with foreign keys that link to associated dimension tables.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Stores **numeric measures** intended for mathematical computations and quantitative analysis.
- Acts as the **center** of the star schema.
- Each row represents a specific event or transaction, described through links to dimension records.

**Contents:**
- **Measures:** Numeric values such as sales amount, units sold, revenue, profit.
- **Foreign Keys:** References to dimension tables (e.g., product ID, customer ID, date key).

**Example:**  
A `Sales_Fact` table might include:
- `DateKey`
- `ProductKey`
- `CustomerKey`
- `StoreKey`
- `UnitsSold`
- `SalesAmount`

---

## 19. Facts

**Definition:**  
Facts are the numeric measurements that represent a specific business aspect or activity.

**Key Points:**
- Stored in the **fact table**, which is the central table of the star schema.
- Facts are linked to **dimensions** that provide context for analysis.
- Facts are often **aggregatable** (e.g., summing sales amounts).

**Types of Facts:**
1. **Additive Facts:** Can be summed across all dimensions (e.g., total sales).
2. **Semi-Additive Facts:** Can be summed across some dimensions but not all (e.g., account balances).
3. **Non-Additive Facts:** Cannot be summed across dimensions (e.g., ratios, percentages).

**Run-Time Metrics:**
- Some facts can be computed on demand rather than stored, such as calculating profit margin from revenue and cost.

---

## 20. Dimensions

**Definition:**  
Dimensions are descriptive attributes that provide context and meaning to the numeric facts in a fact table.

**Key Points:**
- Allow analysis of facts from different perspectives (e.g., by time, product, location).
- Stored in **dimension tables** separate from the fact table.
- Decision support data is almost always viewed in relation to dimensions.

**Examples of Common Dimensions:**
- **Time Dimension:** Year, quarter, month, day.
- **Product Dimension:** Product name, category, brand.
- **Customer Dimension:** Name, location, demographic details.
- **Store Dimension:** Store name, region, type.

**Purpose:**
- Enable filtering, grouping, and categorization of facts in analytical queries.
- Provide multiple angles for drilling down or rolling up in reports.

---

## 21. Dimension Tables

**Definition:**  
A dimension table contains the descriptive information (attributes) related to a particular dimension in the star schema.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Columns:** Usually contain textual or categorical data (e.g., product name, customer location), but can also include numeric descriptive attributes (e.g., product weight, customer income level).
- **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row in the table.
- Linked to the fact table via a **foreign key**.

**Purpose:**
- Provide context for interpreting facts.
- Facilitate filtering, grouping, and classification in analytical queries.

**Example â€“ Product Dimension Table:**
| ProductKey | ProductName     | Brand       | Category     | Color  |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 101        | Alpine Tent 2P  | SummitPro   | Camping Gear | Green  |
| 102        | Trail Backpack  | Pacifica    | Hiking Gear  | Blue   |

---

## 22. Attributes

**Definition:**  
Attributes are the individual data elements in a dimension table that describe a fact from a specific perspective.

**Key Points:**
- Attributes are the descriptive columns within dimension tables.
- They are used to **search**, **filter**, **group**, and **classify** facts in analytical queries.
- There is no fixed limit to the number of attributes a dimension can have.

**Examples:**
- In a **Product Dimension**: product name, brand, category, color, size.
- In a **Customer Dimension**: customer name, gender, age group, income level.
- In a **Time Dimension**: year, quarter, month, day of week.

**Role in Analysis:**
- Attributes form the basis for drill-down and roll-up operations in OLAP.
- They enable creating hierarchies for more flexible data exploration.

---

## 23. Star Schema Representation

**Overview:**  
- In a star schema, the **subject of analysis** is represented by a central **fact table**.  
- Surrounding it are **dimension tables** that provide descriptive context for the facts.  
- This layout visually resembles a star when diagrammed.

**Relationships:**
- The **fact table** is linked to each dimension table in a **many-to-one (M:1)** relationship.
- Links are implemented using **foreign keys** in the fact table pointing to **primary keys** in the dimension tables.
- These relationships are subject to standard **primary/foreign key constraints** in the database.

**Purpose:**
- Organizes data for easy querying and reporting.
- Preserves relational database structure while supporting multidimensional analysis.

---

## 24. Characteristics of Dimensions & Facts

**Dimensions:**
- Typically contain **relatively static data**.
- Store descriptive attributes used for categorizing and filtering facts.
- Dimension tables are generally **much smaller** than fact tables in terms of record count.

**Facts:**
- Represent numeric, measurable data points tied to specific business events.
- Stored in the **fact table**, which grows rapidly as new events occur.
- Records in fact tables are **continually added**, reflecting ongoing transactions or activities.

**Key Size Relationship:**
- In a typical dimensional model, **dimension tables** have far fewer rows than **fact tables**.
- This difference in size is due to the fact table storing many transactional records, while dimensions store a finite set of descriptive values.

---

## 25. Surrogate Key

**Definition:**  
A **surrogate key** is a system-generated, non-composite primary key used in dimension tables within a star schema.

**Key Points:**
- Typically implemented as a simple **auto-increment integer**.
- Has **no inherent meaning** or business logicâ€”its sole purpose is to uniquely identify a row in the dimension table.
- Replaces the use of **operational keys** from source systems in the dimensional model.

**Benefits:**
- Simplifies joins between fact and dimension tables.
- Isolates the Data Warehouse from changes in operational system keys.
- Improves performance due to smaller key size compared to composite or string-based keys.

**Example:**
Instead of using `ProductCode` from an operational system:
| ProductKey | ProductCode | ProductName   |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 101        | P-AXT-202   | Alpine Tent 2P|

---

## 26. Dimensional vs. Non-Dimensional Database

**Dimensional Database (Star Schema / OLAP):**
- Designed for **analytical** purposes.
- Data is organized into **fact tables** and **dimension tables**.
- Queries are simpler and more intuitive for business analysts.
- Optimized for **read-heavy workloads** and aggregation.
- Reduces the complexity of joins when answering analytical questions.

**Non-Dimensional Database (Operational / OLTP):**
- Designed for **transaction processing**.
- Data is stored in highly normalized relational tables.
- Queries can require multiple complex joins for analysis.
- Optimized for **write-heavy workloads** and ensuring data integrity.
- Better for handling day-to-day operations but less efficient for large-scale analytics.

**Key Insight:**  
Even with a small dataset from a single source, analytical queries on a dimensional model are often significantly simpler compared to equivalent queries on a non-dimensional (normalized) database.

---

## 27. Expanded Dimension Based on Multiple Sources

**Concept:**  
- A single dimension in a Data Warehouse can be **enriched** by combining data from multiple source systems.
- This process increases the **depth and quality** of the descriptive information available for analysis.

**Example Scenario â€“ Retail Company Sales Analysis:**
- **Transaction System:** Provides sales details (product ID, units sold, sales amount).
- **Store Settings System:** Adds store type, region, and size attributes.
- **Customer Profile System:** Adds demographic data such as age group, income level, and loyalty status.

**Benefits:**
- Creates a more **comprehensive view** of the dimension entity (e.g., Customer, Product, Store).
- Enhances analytical capabilities by allowing cross-analysis across previously separate datasets.
- Reduces the need for multiple lookups during query execution.

---

## 28. Multiple Facts in a Dimensional Model

**Definition:**  
When a dimensional model supports more than one subject of analysis, it can contain **multiple fact tables** that share common dimensions.

**Key Points:**
- Also known as a **constellation schema** or **galaxy schema**.
- Dimensions are **reused** across different fact tables instead of being duplicated.
- Enables **cross-fact analysis** using shared dimensions.

**Benefits:**
1. **Efficiency in Development:**  
   - New analytical subjects can be added more quickly by reusing existing dimensions.
2. **Consistency:**  
   - Shared dimensions ensure consistent definitions and reporting across different subject areas.
3. **Flexibility:**  
   - Allows for combined analysis across multiple business processes.

**Example:**
In a retail Data Warehouse:
- **Sales Fact Table:** Tracks revenue, units sold.
- **Returns Fact Table:** Tracks quantity returned, refund amount.
- Both share dimensions like `Date`, `Product`, `Store`, and `Customer`.

---

## 29. Multiple Fact Tables

**Definition:**  
A dimensional model may contain multiple fact tables when different business subjects require separate sets of facts, but still share common dimensions.

**Key Points:**
- Multiple fact tables enable analysis of **distinct but related business processes**.
- Often used when facts come from different operational systems or when each fact set has different granularity.
- This setup is common in a **constellation (galaxy) schema**.

**Example â€“ Retail Company:**
- **Sales Fact Table:** Measures units sold, sales amount, discount.
- **Defects Fact Table:** Measures defect count, defect type, defect resolution time.
- Shared Dimensions: `Date`, `Product`, `Store`, `Customer`.

**Benefits:**
- Allows **parallel analysis** of different performance areas.
- Enables **integrated reporting** by leveraging shared dimensions.
- Avoids duplication of dimension tables across different analytical areas.

---

## 30. Detailed vs. Aggregated Fact Tables

**Detailed Fact Tables:**
- Each record corresponds to a **single business event** or transaction.
- Provide the **finest level of granularity** available.
- Enable highly detailed analysis but can be large and slower to query.
- Example: Each row in a sales fact table represents a single product sold in a specific transaction.

**Aggregated Fact Tables:**
- Each record summarizes **multiple events**.
- Have a **coarser granularity** than detailed tables.
- Improve query performance for common summary-level analyses.
- Example: A pre-computed daily sales total per store, rather than individual transactions.

**Comparison:**
| Feature          | Detailed Fact Table | Aggregated Fact Table |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Granularity      | Fine               | Coarse                |
| Table Size       | Very Large         | Smaller               |
| Query Performance| Slower             | Faster                |
| Flexibility      | High               | Lower                 |

**Best Practice:**  
Some Data Warehouses maintain **both detailed and aggregated fact tables** in the same dimensional model to balance flexibility with performance.

---

## 31. Granularity of the Fact Tables

**Definition:**  
Granularity describes what a **single row** in a fact table represents â€” the level of detail captured for each fact.

**Key Points:**
- **Fine Granularity:**  
  - Each record represents a single, specific event or measurement.  
  - Example: An individual product sold in a single transaction at a specific store.
- **Coarse Granularity:**  
  - Each record summarizes multiple events into a single measurement.  
  - Example: Total daily sales per store.

**Impact on Performance and Flexibility:**
- **Fine granularity** allows detailed analysis but results in larger tables and longer query times.
- **Coarse granularity** improves performance but reduces analytical flexibility.

**Best Practice:**  
Some Data Warehouses store **both detailed and aggregated fact tables** in the same schema (constellation) to combine the advantages of both approaches.


---

## 32. Snowflake Model

**Definition:**  
A **snowflake model** is a variation of the star schema in which one or more dimension tables are **normalized** into multiple related tables.

**Key Points:**
- Results in a structure that resembles a snowflake shape when diagrammed.
- Normalization reduces redundancy in dimension tables.
- Commonly involves breaking a dimension into multiple linked tables (e.g., `Product` â†’ `Product Category` â†’ `Product Department`).

**Advantages:**
- Reduces storage requirements.
- Simplifies updates to dimension data.

**Disadvantages:**
- Increases query complexity due to more joins.
- Can reduce query performance compared to a denormalized star schema.

**Best Practice:**  
Snowflaking is **usually avoided** in analytical databases unless there is a compelling reason (e.g., storage constraints or frequently changing dimension attributes).

---

## 33. Performance-Improving Techniques

Several techniques can enhance query performance and efficiency in a Data Warehouse:

1. **Normalization of Dimensional Tables**  
   - Reduce redundancy in dimension data to save storage and simplify updates.  
   - Used selectively, as it can slow down queries due to extra joins.

2. **Multiple Fact Tables at Different Aggregation Levels**  
   - Maintain both detailed and aggregated fact tables to balance flexibility with speed.

3. **Denormalization of Fact Tables**  
   - Pre-compute and store certain measures or relationships to reduce the need for complex joins.

4. **Table Partitioning**  
   - Split large tables into smaller, more manageable segments (e.g., by date or region) to improve query speed.

5. **Replication**  
   - Create copies of frequently accessed tables or subsets to reduce contention and improve availability.

**Goal:**  
Apply these techniques selectively to optimize performance without sacrificing analytical capability.
