## 1. Cryptography
- **Definition**: The science and practice of securing communication through codes, ciphers, and mathematical techniques.  
- **Goal**: Ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation.  
- **Analogy**: Like locking your diary with a padlock so only the person with the right key can read it.

---

## 2. Cryptanalysis
- **Definition**: The study of breaking or bypassing cryptographic systems without having the secret key.  
- **Goal**: Expose weaknesses in ciphers and test their security.  
- **Analogy**: A locksmith who tries to pick the lock or find shortcuts to open it.

---

## 3. Cryptographer
- **Definition**: A person who designs or studies secure cryptographic algorithms.  
- **Role**: Build the locks, safes, and vaults.  
- **Example**: The designers of AES (Rijndael algorithm) are cryptographers.

---

## 4. Cryptanalyst
- **Definition**: A person who analyzes ciphers to find flaws or break them.  
- **Role**: Break the locks or prove they are strong enough.  
- **Example**: Frequency analysis experts who cracked substitution ciphers.

---

## 5. Summary & Takeaways
- **Cryptography** = making locks.  
- **Cryptanalysis** = breaking locks.  
- **Cryptographer** = lock designer.  
- **Cryptanalyst** = lock picker.  

Both sides are necessary: strong systems are only proven secure when cryptanalysts fail to break them.
