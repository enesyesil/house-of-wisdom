# üèõÔ∏è House of Wisdom

![House of Wisdom Banner](./banner.png)

Welcome to my digital library ‚Äî a living archive of everything I'm learning in AI, Cloud Infrastructure, System Design, and beyond.

This is a ‚Äúlearn in public‚Äù lab, where I break down complex topics as I study them.

## Topics I'm Exploring
- Artificial Intelligence
- Backend & Systems Engineering
- Distributed Systems
- Computer Science Fundamentals
- Philosophical Reflections on Computation
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Terraform)
- Philosophical and historical tech reflections (sometimes)

## Sections

### `cs-fundamentals/`
Core computer science principles ‚Äî from algorithms to memory.

### `cloud-systems-ai/`
Modern infrastructure and applied intelligence ‚Äî practical, hands-on topics.

### `philosophy-of-computing/`
Deep questions behind what we build:
- What is computation?
- Is software language?
- What is abstraction really?

### `learn-journal/`
Personal logs as I explore the unknown, reflect, and reframe my understanding.

## Why This Exists

Inspired by the original House of Wisdom, this repo is my attempt to blend:
- Technical precision,
- Historical awareness,
- And philosophical inquiry.
